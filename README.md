## üéØ Objective

The goal of this system is to **analyze the strength of a password** through **multi-dimensional evaluation layers** and provide **intelligent suggestions** to improve password security. By simulating different types of real-world attacks (e.g., brute force, social engineering, breached databases), it ensures each password undergoes rigorous scrutiny.

## üß† Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
- **Password Hashing & Security:** bcrypt, Bloom filters  
- **Security Models & Logic:** zxcvbn, Entropy calculations  
- **Explainability:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)  
- **Generative AI:** Mistral LLM for intelligent feedback and password generation  
- **Data:** Breached datasets like RockYou, LinkedIn leaks

---

## üîê Multi-Layered Architecture

This system evaluates passwords across **five key layers**, each simulating a real-world attack vector or analysis dimension:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Breached Password Identification**  
- **Type:** Brute Force Attack Simulation  
- **Approach:** Checks the password against known leaked datasets like RockYou and LinkedIn dumps using Bloom Filters for fast lookup.  
- **Goal:** Prevent the use of passwords that are already publicly exposed.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Banned & Fuzzy Word Detection (PII-Based)**  
- **Type:** Social Engineering Attack Simulation  
- **Approach:** Identifies passwords containing or resembling personal identifiable data (PII) such as names, DOBs, email fragments using fuzzy matching.  
- **Goal:** Detect predictable or easily guessable patterns related to user identity.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Password Composition Strength Analysis**  
- **Type:** Pure Brute Force Simulation  
- **Approach:** Analyzes structure based on character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols), repetition patterns, keyboard adjacency, and dictionary patterns using **zxcvbn**.  
- **Goal:** Evaluate complexity against generic brute-force attacks.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Entropy Calculation & Crack Time Estimation**  
- **Approach:** Calculates Shannon entropy and uses combinatorial logic to estimate crack time against common attack strategies.  
- **Goal:** Quantify randomness and evaluate resilience to password cracking tools.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **GenAI-Based Password Strength Feedback and Generation**  
- **Approach:**  
  - Uses **Mistral LLM** to generate strong passwords tailored to security requirements.
  - Interactively updates password based on user queries (e.g., "make it easier to remember", "add a special character", "use a word I like").  
- **Goal:** Achieve a balance between security, unpredictability, and user memorability.

---

## üí¨ AI-Powered Feedback Loop

Each layer provides:
- **Scoring**
- **Risk Explanation using SHAP**
- **Actionable Suggestions from LLM**

The system returns an **aggregated strength score**, visual feedback, and intelligent suggestions that adapt based on specific vulnerabilities detected in each layer.

---

## üîÑ Password Generation System

- Users can **query the LLM** to generate passwords that:
  - Avoid banned patterns
  - Match complexity standards
  - Are easier to remember while maintaining entropy
- Includes **interactive update system** that lets users modify generated passwords (e.g., change structure, add memorable phrases).
