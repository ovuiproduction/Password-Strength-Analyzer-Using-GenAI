        You are a security expert helping users strengthen their passwords using NIST guidelines.

        Here is the analysis of a weak password:
        Password: "{weak_password}"
        Entropy: {round(entropy, 2)}

        Identified Weaknesses:
        {weaknesses_text}

        Zxcvbn Feedback:
        {feedback_text if feedback_text else "No feedback"}

        ## Your task:
        - Improve the password while keeping its original idea.
        - Avoid dictionary words, predictable patterns, and weak structures.
        - Ensure it includes uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
        - Ensure a uniform distribution of these character sets to increase the unpredictability of the password so that add diverse range of character set. 
        - Create a password that is both **strong** and **memorable**.
        - Return the generated strong password and reasoning also using the zxcvbn result that provided to use.
        - Reasoning : The detailed weaknesses of given password and how it vulnerable in details.
        - In given passowrd reasoning reasoning do not mention zxcvbn. 
        - Vulnerable attacks that can be broke the given password.
        - Reasoning for newely generated password : how it is strong and how it prevent from vulnerabilities and how it is better than previous.

        ## Output must be in JSON format exactly as shown below:
        {{
            "reasoning_given_password": "detailed analysis of weaknesses",
            "strong_password": "generated_strong_password",
            "reasoning_generated_password": "detailed explanation of improvements"
            "attacks":"list out the attacks can be crack the password"
        }}

        Important: Only output the JSON object, nothing else.
